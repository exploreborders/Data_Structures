# Personal Notes for Chapter 2

- Sequence-Selection-Iteration: Foundation of programming.
- Variables are names pointing to objects; objects have identity, type, value.
- Mutable vs immutable: Lists are mutable, tuples/strings are immutable.
- Collections: Each has specific uses (lists for ordered mutable, dicts for key-value, etc.).
- Control flow: Python's simplicity with indentation.
- Modules: Use __name__ == '__main__' for scripts.

## Key Takeaways
- Expressions evaluate to values; statements don't.
- Slicing creates new objects, can be expensive for large collections.
- Duck typing allows flexibility in function arguments.
- Import conventions: Avoid * imports.

## Exercises/Thoughts
- Experiment with object identity using `is`.
- Practice slicing and negative indices.
- Write functions with different parameter types to see duck typing.
