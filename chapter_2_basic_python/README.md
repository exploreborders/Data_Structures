# Chapter 2: Basic Python

This chapter covers fundamental Python concepts: sequence, selection, and iteration; expressions and evaluation; variables, types, and state; collections (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets); common operations; iterating over collections; other control flow; and modules/imports.

## Key Concepts
- **Sequence, Selection, Iteration**: The mental model for programming.
- **Expressions**: Evaluation and operators.
- **Variables**: Names, objects, identity, type, value.
- **Collections**: Strings, lists, tuples, dicts, sets with operations like len, slicing, membership.
- **Control Flow**: if, while, try, functions.
- **Modules**: Importing and namespaces.

## Examples
- Basic arithmetic and boolean expressions.
- Mutable vs immutable objects.
- List operations and dictionary usage.
- Iteration with for loops and range.
- Function definitions and calls.
- Import statements and module structure.
