# Personal Notes for Chapter 3

- OOP makes code closer to how we think about problems.
- Classes encapsulate data and behavior.
- Inheritance: Use only for "is a" (e.g., Triangle is a Polygon).
- Composition: Use for "has a" (e.g., Car has an Engine).
- Duck typing: More flexible than inheritance in Python.
- Encapsulation: Respect public interfaces to avoid breaking changes.

## Key Takeaways
- `__init__` initializes objects; `self` refers to instance.
- Private attributes start with `_`; not enforced but conventional.
- Method resolution order: Instance → Class → Superclass.
- Magic methods enable operator overloading.
- Inheritance should factor out common code.

## Exercises/Thoughts
- Refactor a procedural program to OOP.
- Compare inheritance vs composition for a real problem.
- Experiment with duck typing vs explicit types.
