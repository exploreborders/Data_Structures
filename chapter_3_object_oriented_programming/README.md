# Chapter 3: Object-Oriented Programming

This chapter covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python: classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, composition, and duck typing.

## Key Concepts
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, creating instances with `__init__`.
- **Encapsulation**: Public/private interfaces, data hiding.
- **Inheritance**: "Is a" relationships, subclasses, method resolution order.
- **Composition**: "Has a" relationships, building complex objects.
- **Duck Typing**: Polymorphism without explicit inheritance.
- **Magic Methods**: `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.

## Examples
- Vector class with arithmetic operations.
- Polygon hierarchy (Triangle, Square) using inheritance.
- MyLimitedList using composition.
- Demonstrating encapsulation and duck typing.
