## ❓ FAQ

### **How do I navigate such a large repository?**
Start with `chapter_01_overview` to understand the educational approach, then follow the curriculum progression. Each chapter is self-contained with its own README explaining the concepts.

### **What's the best order to study the chapters?**
Follow the numbered order (01-22) as they build progressively in complexity. The curriculum is designed so later chapters build on earlier concepts.

### **How do these implementations differ from Python's standard library?**
These are educational implementations focused on clarity and learning. Python's `list.sort()` uses Timsort (hybrid of merge and insertion sort), while our implementations show the underlying algorithms.

### **Can I use this for interview preparation?**
Absolutely! The comprehensive test coverage and multiple implementation variants make this excellent for understanding algorithms deeply rather than just memorizing solutions.

### **Why so much emphasis on testing?**
Thorough testing ensures algorithmic correctness and helps identify edge cases. Each implementation includes comprehensive tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and performance characteristics.
