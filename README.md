# Data Structures in Python - Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring "A First Course on Data Structures in Python" by Donald R. Sheehy. We'll implement concepts chapter by chapter, with code examples, tests, and personal notes.

## Learning Goals
- Master Python fundamentals and object-oriented programming
- Understand data structures and algorithms
- Practice testing and performance analysis
- Build a comprehensive codebase incrementally

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run tests: `pytest`

## Structure
Each chapter has its own directory with:
- `code/`: Implementations
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `examples/`: Usage examples
- `notes.md`: Personal notes and takeaways
- `README.md`: Chapter summary

## Progress
- [ ] Chapter 1: Overview
- [ ] Chapter 2: Basic Python
- ... (more to be added)

## Contributing
This is a personal learning project. Feel free to fork and adapt.
